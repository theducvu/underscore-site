# Roughly speaking, this module is most important for implementing "global
# variables" that are available in every template with the Django feature of
# "context processors". But it also does some stuff with caching computed
# properties of teams (the caching is only within a single request (?)). See
# https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/templates/api/#using-requestcontext

# This object is a request-scoped cache containing data calculated for the
# current request. As a motivating example: showing current DEEP in the top
# bar and rendering the puzzles page both need the list of puzzles the current
# team has solved. This object ensures it only needs to be computed once,
# without explicitly having to pass it around from one place to the other.

# There are currently two types of contexts: request Contexts (below) and Team
# models (in models.py). Simple properties that are generally useful to either
# can go in BaseContext. The fact that Teams are contexts enables the above
# caching benefits when calculating things like a team's solves, unlocked
# puzzles, or remaining hints -- whether you're looking at your own logged-in
# team or another team's details page.
