        <h4>What is a puzzlehunt? How do I solve these puzzles?</h4>
        <p>If you&rsquo;ve never heard of puzzlehunts before, here&rsquo;s a very brief summary: in a typical puzzle, you receive some information and have to extract an answer out of it, which is almost always an English word or phrase. Puzzles can come in many different forms; the only real commonality is that you usually receive no direct instructions, so it&rsquo;s up to you to figure out how to make sense of the information you&rsquo;re given. You can read a longer introduction to puzzlehunts <a href="https://blog.vero.site/post/puzzlehunts" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
        <p>If you are new to puzzles and are interested in seeing some examples, or if you&rsquo;re looking for some practice, we recommend looking at puzzles from other online hunts such as <a target="_blank" href="https://galacticpuzzlehunt.com/">Galactic Puzzle Hunt</a>, <a target="_blank" href ="https://teammatehunt.com/">Teammate Hunt</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://puzzlepotluck.com/">Puzzle Potluck</a>, or <a target="_blank" href="https://reddothunt.sg/2018">REDDOThunt</a>.</p>
